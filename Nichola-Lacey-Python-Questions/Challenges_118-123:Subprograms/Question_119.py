# Define a subprogram that will ask the user to pick a low and a high number, and then generate a random number between those two values and store it in a variable called “comp_num”.

# Define another subprogram that will give the instruction “I am thinking of a number...” and then ask the user to guess the number they are thinking of.

# Define a third subprogram that will check to see if the comp_num is the same as the user’s guess. If it is, it should display the message “Correct, you win”, otherwise it should keep looping, telling the user if they are too low or too high and asking them to guess again until they guess correctly.
